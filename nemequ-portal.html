      <h2>What is nēmequ?</h2>
      <p>The Akkadian term nēmequ means “knowledge.” But it differs in several respects from the ways in which we characterize “knowledge” in the Classical philosophical traditions of the West. For example, nēmequ can describe both the knowledge of a glass-maker and a scribe; the term nēmequ would not distinguish between the knowledge of a professor and the knowledge of a plumber.</p>

      <p>Investigations of nēmequ lie at the core of cuneiform intellectual history. Explore some key technical knowledge texts below:</p>

        <h2>Recipes and Semantic Ingredient Networks</h2>
        <p>Recipes are notoriously difficult to replicate. (Consider those failed attempts to recreate grandma’s famous dessert!) Recipes from dead civilizations are more difficult still. They often employ rare terms for ingredients, materials, and processes that are elsewhere unattested. As a result of this problem, I have turned my attention to conceptualizing cuneiform recipes as visual semantic networks of ingredients.</p>

        <p>Semantic Ingredient Networks (SIN) apply Social Network Analysis (SNA) principles to groups of words that appear in cuneiform technical recipes according to frequency of occurrences (word count), and connections between words and phrases in a recipe (syntactic relations).</p>

        <h2>Technology as Knowledge</h2>

        <p>Intuitively, technology  refers to the—principally human—manipulation of the material world aimed at the manufacture of physical objects that modify the ways in which we interact with the world. Technological objects might include anything from a plow to an iPad. But the study of technological objects accounts often fails to account for technology’s rich intellectual history.</p>

        <p>Anchored in the history and philosophy of science, my dissertation looks beyond our intuitive approach to technology as solely the study of objects and considers instead technology as a form of knowledge. This work focuses special attention on the ways in which ancient scholars interpreted and categorized the manipulation of materials derived from what we now recognize as the natural world. Cuneiform procedural recipes composed and copied between the second and first millennium BCE comprise the principal data-set of my study.</p>
